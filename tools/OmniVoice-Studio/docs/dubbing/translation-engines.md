# Translation engines (Dub tab)

OmniVoice dubs in two steps: **transcribe → translate → speak**. The *translate*
step is pluggable — pick the engine in the Dub tab's **Engine** dropdown. Two
engines are **built in** and always available offline; the rest need a small
optional Python package.

| Engine | Category | Needs a package? | Key needed? |
|--------|----------|------------------|-------------|
| **Argos** (Local, Fast) | offline | `argostranslate` (bundled) | no |
| **NLLB-200** (Local, Heavy) | offline | none (uses core `transformers`) | no |
| Google Translate (Free) | online | `deep_translator` | no |
| DeepL | online | `deep_translator` | yes (`DEEPL_API_KEY`) |
| Microsoft Translator | online | `deep_translator` | yes (`MICROSOFT_API_KEY`) |
| MyMemory | online | `deep_translator` | no |
| LLM (OpenAI-compatible) | llm | `openai` | usually yes |

If you pick an engine whose package isn't importable yet, the Engine label shows
a **highlighted Install affordance**, and — if you try to translate anyway — the
backend returns a single, actionable error telling you exactly what to install
(the install command is single-sourced, so the button and the error never
disagree).

## Installing optional translation engines (from-source vs packaged build)

How you add an engine depends on **how you installed OmniVoice**.

### From-source / dev install (one-click)

If you cloned the repo and run OmniVoice from source (`uv sync` + the dev
launcher) or via Docker, the app can install engines for you:

1. In the Dub tab, open the translation settings and pick the engine you want
   (e.g. **Google Translate**) from the **Engine** dropdown.
2. A highlighted **Install** button appears next to the *Engine* label. Click it.
3. OmniVoice runs the install into the **same** Python environment the backend
   is using (`uv pip install <package> --python <backend-interpreter>`), then
   re-probes. When it reports *"restart the backend to load it"*, restart so the
   freshly-installed module is importable.

You can also install by hand into the backend venv:

```
uv pip install deep_translator   # Google / DeepL / Microsoft / MyMemory
uv pip install argostranslate    # Argos (already bundled; rarely needed)
uv pip install openai            # LLM (OpenAI-compatible) provider
```

Then restart the backend.

### Packaged / installer build (read-only — use the popover)

The signed desktop installers (`.dmg`, `.msi`, AppImage, `.deb`) ship a
**read-only, code-signed Python environment**. Installing extra packages into it
would break the signature, so **in-app install is intentionally disabled** on
these builds. Selecting an uninstalled engine there shows a highlighted button
that opens a small popover with everything you need:

- **The exact command** to run (with a copy-to-clipboard button) if you *do*
  have a from-source checkout somewhere and want the online engines there.
- **Switch to Argos (bundled, offline)** — one click. Argos and NLLB are always
  importable in every build, so this is the guaranteed escape hatch: you can
  keep dubbing immediately, fully offline, no install required.
- A link back to this page.

**Recommendation for packaged builds:** just use **Argos** (fast, offline) or
**NLLB-200** (heavier, higher quality, offline). They need nothing installed and
never leave your machine. Reach for the online engines only from a from-source
install where you can add their package.

## Translation quality: Fast, Autofit, Cinematic

The **Quality** control in the Dub tab (and Settings → Translation) picks how the
translation is produced:

- **Fast** — a direct one-shot translation from the selected engine (Argos, NLLB,
  Google, …). No LLM, no timing awareness.
- **Cinematic** — an LLM refines the literal translation (reflect → adapt) for
  natural, in-context phrasing.
- **Autofit** — Cinematic **plus** a strict fit-to-time pass: the LLM rewrites
  each line so its target-language reading time fits **within** the segment's
  slot (never overruns it). This keeps the video timing intact and avoids the
  stressed audio time-stretch you get when a translation is too long for its
  slot. Fit is per-language pronunciation-speed aware.

Cinematic and Autofit **require an LLM** (below). If none is configured, they
fall back to Fast with a notice.

## LLM Providers (for Cinematic / Autofit)

**Settings → System → LLM Providers** is the one place to set up the LLM. Pick a
provider, paste its API key, choose a model, **Test** it, and "use for
translation." Supported: OpenAI, OpenRouter, Groq, Cerebras, Google AI (Gemini),
Mistral, Cohere, NVIDIA, GitHub Models, Cloudflare, Hugging Face, SambaNova,
SiliconFlow, **local Ollama / LM Studio** (offline, no key), and a **Custom**
OpenAI-compatible endpoint.

Keys entered here are stored **encrypted** on your machine and never returned to
the UI. For a fully offline setup, pick **Ollama** (`ollama pull llama3.1`) or
**LM Studio** — nothing leaves the machine. Power users can still override any
provider via environment variables (e.g. `GROQ_API_KEY`, or the legacy
`TRANSLATE_BASE_URL` / `TRANSLATE_API_KEY` / `TRANSLATE_MODEL`, which map to the
**Custom** provider).

### Pinning the active provider with `LLM_DEFAULT_PROVIDER`

By default the LLM used for Cinematic/Autofit is the one you mark "use for
translation" in **Settings → LLM Providers**. To force a specific provider
regardless of that stored selection — handy for headless/CI/Docker runs or a
shared machine — set the `LLM_DEFAULT_PROVIDER` environment variable to a
provider id before launching the backend:

```
LLM_DEFAULT_PROVIDER=groq        # or openai, openrouter, cerebras, ollama, custom, …
```

Resolution order for the active provider is: `LLM_DEFAULT_PROVIDER` (env) →
your saved selection → the first provider that has a key → none. The id must be
one OmniVoice knows (the ids shown in **Settings → LLM Providers**); an unknown
value is ignored and resolution falls through to your saved selection. While
this env var is set it wins over the in-app picker, so if the UI selection
appears to have "no effect," check whether `LLM_DEFAULT_PROVIDER` is exported.

## LLM Skills (per-feature routing)

**Settings → System → LLM Skills** lists every LLM-powered feature — Cinematic &
Autofit translation, speech-rate slot fitting, glossary auto-extract, direction
parsing, and dictation cleanup — and lets you toggle each one or route it to a
specific provider instead of the global active one. That way sensitive work
(e.g. dictation cleanup) can stay on a local Ollama/LM Studio model while
heavier jobs use a remote provider. A disabled skill degrades exactly like
having no LLM configured: Cinematic/Autofit falls back to Fast, dictation
cleanup passes the raw transcript through, direction parsing uses the keyword
heuristic. Everything defaults to enabled + "use active provider", so existing
setups behave unchanged.

## API keys (online MT engines)

The non-LLM online engines need a key, set as an environment variable before
launching the backend (or in **Settings → Credentials**):

- **DeepL:** `DEEPL_API_KEY` (optionally `DEEPL_BASE_URL` for a self-hosted /
  pro endpoint).
- **Microsoft Translator:** `MICROSOFT_API_KEY` (optionally `MICROSOFT_BASE_URL`).

## Troubleshooting

- **"The 'google' translation engine needs the optional deep_translator Python
  package…"** — the package isn't installed. On a from-source install, click the
  Install button (or run the command above) and restart. On a packaged build,
  switch to Argos/NLLB via the popover.
- **Install button does nothing / says "disabled in packaged builds"** — you're
  on a signed installer build (expected). Use Argos/NLLB, or add the package in a
  from-source checkout.
- **Installed it but still "needs install"** — restart the backend so Python
  picks up the newly-installed module.

# Remote GPU backend

Run the OmniVoice backend on one machine (a GPU box, a home server) and drive
it from the desktop app or a browser on another — over your tailnet, with the
inference staying on the powerful machine.

This is opt-in and off by default: with no API key set, the backend stays
loopback-only exactly as before.

## The shape

```
┌──────────────┐     tailnet (WireGuard)      ┌─────────────────────┐
│ laptop        │  ws/https to MagicDNS URL   │ gpu-box              │
│ OmniVoice UI  │ ──────────────────────────▶ │ OmniVoice backend    │
│ (thin client) │  Authorization: Bearer …    │ OMNIVOICE_API_KEY set │
└──────────────┘                              └─────────────────────┘
```

The desktop app *is* the thin client — there is no separate binary. You set a
**Backend URL** and an **API key** in Settings, and every request (including
the dictation and TTS WebSockets) is sent to the remote with the key attached.

## 1. On the GPU box: run the backend with a key

Generate a key and start the backend with it set:

```bash
export OMNIVOICE_API_KEY="$(python -c 'import secrets; print(secrets.token_urlsafe(24))')"
export OMNIVOICE_SERVER_MODE=1          # headless: relaxes the loopback admin gate
uv run uvicorn backend.main:app --host 0.0.0.0 --port 3900
```

The Docker image is the same idea — pass `-e OMNIVOICE_API_KEY=…`.

When `OMNIVOICE_API_KEY` is set, **every non-loopback HTTP and WebSocket
request must present it**, as `Authorization: Bearer <key>`, `?api_key=<key>`
(browser WebSockets can't set headers), or the `ov_key` cookie the backend
sets after the first authenticated request. Loopback traffic on the box
itself is never gated, so local tools keep working.

## 2. Reach it over Tailscale

Install [Tailscale](https://tailscale.com/) on both machines (its client is
BSD-3 open source; self-host the control plane with
[headscale](https://github.com/juanfont/headscale) if you want a fully open
stack). Then the box is reachable at its MagicDNS name:

```
http://gpu-box.your-tailnet.ts.net:3900
```

For TLS (recommended — see the warning below), put the port behind
**Tailscale Serve** on the box:

```bash
tailscale serve 3900
# now reachable at https://gpu-box.your-tailnet.ts.net
```

Serve terminates on the node and forwards from `127.0.0.1`, so to the backend
the request looks like loopback — which is why the **API key is still
required** in that path (the bearer gate doesn't rely on the source address
for non-local exposure; set the key and it always applies to keyed clients).

> **Do not use `tailscale funnel`** (public-internet exposure) for this. Even
> with a key, a voice-cloning backend should not be on the open internet.

## 3. In the app: point at the remote

Settings → Sharing → **Remote backend**:

- **Backend URL**: the MagicDNS URL from step 2 (with `:3900` if you didn't
  use Serve, or no port if you did).
- **API key**: the value of `OMNIVOICE_API_KEY` from step 1.
- **Test connection** hits `{url}/health` and shows the remote's version and
  device.
- **Save & reload** stores both in this browser/app and restarts the UI
  against the remote.

Leave the URL empty to go back to the local backend.

## Security notes

- **Plain HTTP is sniffable.** A bearer key over `http://` on a hostile
  network can be read off the wire. Use Tailscale (WireGuard-encrypted) or
  Tailscale Serve (TLS) for anything beyond a fully trusted LAN.
- The API key and the LAN-share **PIN** are independent: the PIN guards a
  casual share session, the key is the durable remote credential. Either can
  be active; both are checked when set.
- Admin routes (`/system/*`, `/api/settings/*`) stay loopback-gated unless
  `OMNIVOICE_SERVER_MODE=1` is set on the box; in server mode the key is the
  access control for those too.
- The key is compared in constant time and never logged.

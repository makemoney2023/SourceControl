"""Chunked TTS generation utilities (Wave 1.2 — unlimited-length generation).

Adapted from voicebox (https://github.com/jamiepine/voicebox), MIT License,
Copyright (c) voicebox contributors. The concatenation half is reworked for
torch tensors (our inference helpers pass raw model output — possibly
multi-channel — to the effect chain), and the sample rate comes from the
engine's declared rate rather than the first chunk (fixes a latent upstream
bug where a mid-run rate change was silently ignored).

Splits long text into sentence-boundary chunks and joins the per-chunk audio
with a short crossfade. Pure functions — the generation loop itself lives in
``api/routers/generation.py`` next to the existing ``[pause]`` span stitcher,
so this module stays unit-testable without a model.

Short text (<= max_chunk_chars) never reaches this module's concat path; the
callers keep their unchanged single-shot fast path.
